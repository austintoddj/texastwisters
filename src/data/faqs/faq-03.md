question: What should my child wear to class?
answer: Girls are required to wear a leotard or a snug-fitting shirt paired with shorts during practice sessions. We kindly request that sports bras, spanks, and two-piece workout outfits not be worn. For boys, appropriate attire consists of shorts and a well-fitting shirt. To ensure safety, all athletes need to remove necklaces and bracelets when in practice to prevent injury, broken items, and damage to the gym equipment.
