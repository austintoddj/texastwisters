question: What should my child wear to class?
answer: Girls are required to wear a leotard or fitted shirt and shorts. We kindly request that two-piece workout outfits not be worn. For boys, appropriate attire consists of shorts without buttons and a well-fitting shirt. To ensure safety, all athletes must remove jewelery (stud earrings are acceptable) during classes. Shoes and socks will be left in the lobby.
