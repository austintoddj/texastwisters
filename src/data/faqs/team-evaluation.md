question: What is the process for joining the competitive team?
answer: Our team program is invite only. If your gymnast has prior team experience, please request an evaluation with our staff for placement. If your gymnast does not have team experience, a "Level 2" class is available for qualifying 4-7 year olds, and a "Pre-team" is offered through our Recreational program for gymnasts 8 and up.
