  ### Billing & Membership

  * **Payment Methods:** We accept debit/credit cards and eChecks for membership fees.

  * **Billing Schedule:** Dues are billed monthly, with equal payments spread across the year to account for months with varying class frequencies.

  * **Enrollment:** Our rolling enrollment allows you to join any class with available spots. Once a payment is made, your spot is secured until you submit a drop request.

  * **Cancellations:** To cancel your enrollment, submit drop requests through the Customer Portal by the 15th of the month prior to the desired cancellation date.

  * **Refunds:** Monthly enrollments, Camps, Open Gym sessions, and Birthday Party registration fees are non-refundable.

  ### Discounts

  * **Multi-Class Discount:** Students enrolled in multiple classes automatically receive a 10% discount on subsequent classes.
  
  * **Sibling Discount:** Families with more than one student enrolled automatically receive a 10% discount on subsequent classes.

  ### Late Fees & Payment Policies

  To ensure your child's spot in a class, tuition is due by the 1st of each month.  We appreciate your prompt payment! To avoid late fees, please settle any outstanding balances by the 7th.  If a balance remains by the 7th, your child will not be able to attend class until the payment is received.  To avoid losing your child's spot entirely, please ensure all balances are paid by the 10th of the month.  Unpaid accounts after this date will result in the enrollment being dropped.  Please note that tuition fees are due regardless of your child's attendance.

  * **Late Payment Fee:** A $15 late fee applies to accounts where automatic payment fails after 7 days.

  * **Returned eCheck Fee:** A $15 processing fee will be added for returned eChecks.

  * **Delinquent Accounts:** We will attempt to contact you about past-due payments. Enrollments will be dropped if payment is not received by the 10th of the month.
