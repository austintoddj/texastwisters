  ## Gym Rules

  * **Parents, spectators and siblings of students** are **NOT** permitted on the gym floor or equipment.

  * Students must remain with a coach at all times during class and cannot go out onto the gym floor or equipment until class is “called” by a coach.

  * Parents may observe all classes from the viewing area only. For safety and instructional reasons, observers must refrain from communicating with students while they are in class.

  * Food and drinks are not permitted anywhere on the gym floor or equipment.

  * Girls are required to wear a leotard or fitted shirt and shorts. We kindly request that two-piece workout outfits not be worn. For boys, appropriate attire consists of shorts without buttons and a well-fitting shirt. To ensure safety, all athletes must remove jewelry (stud earrings are acceptable) during classes. Hair longer than shoulder length must be tied up.

  * Gymnasts must be barefooted (no socks or tights that cover the feet.)

  * All students must wait inside the building to be picked up after class.

  * Water is provided in the lobby area, however we do not provide open cups because of safety concerns around spills. Please bring a water bottle for your child.

  ## Behavior

  The safety and well-being of all our gymnasts is our top priority. To ensure a focused and productive learning environment, we expect all participants to follow safety guidelines and respect coaches' instructions. Failure to adhere to these expectations will result in corrective actions outlined below.

  ### Our Three-Strike System:

  * **Strike One:** The coach will provide a clear and firm verbal warning, explaining the expected behavior and the importance of following the rules.

  * **Strike Two:** If a student receives a second strike due to continued disruptive behavior, the coach will implement a short time-out period.

  * **Strike Three:** For a third strike or a serious safety violation, the coach will return the student to the lobby where they will be reunited with their parent/guardian.
