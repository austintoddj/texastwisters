  ## Drop-off & Pick-up

  Please arrive on time so your child will not miss any warm-up. Children are not permitted to wait outside for their parents. Please pick your child up, on time, inside our facility. At drop-off, all students must have a parent remain with them until their class enters the gym.

  ## Late Pick-up Fee

  If a parent is late to pick up their child, a late fee will be charged. This fee applies to all programs and is due at the time of pick-up. If a child is not picked up within 30 minutes of the class ending, we will call the emergency contacts listed on your account. If we are unable to reach anyone, we will contact the local authorities. Late fees are assessed **per student**:

    * **1-5 minutes:** $5

    * **6-10 minutes:** $20

    * **11-15 minutes:** $30

  ## Emergency Closures & Inclement Weather

  We strive to be open for business as usual. However, unforeseen events like severe weather, natural disasters, or building emergencies may occasionally cause closures. During these times, we recommend calling the gym to confirm our status. Please check our Facebook & Instagram pages as well as your email for weather updates and closure information.

  ## Missed Classes & Makeups

  * **Makeup Classes:** We do not offer individual makeup classes for missed sessions. However, we offer [open gym](/programs/open-gym) tokens as an alternative. Attending open gym is entirely optional. We understand that scheduling conflicts can arise.

  * **Open Gym Tokens:** If your child misses a class, an open gym token is automatically applied to their account. You can receive up to two tokens per month, which expire one year from issuance. These tokens are exclusively for open gym sessions and are non-transferable. Once a makeup token is redeemed, it cannot be reused after the event ends, as it secures a spot that another child could have taken. However, if you provide at least 24 hours' notice before the open gym, the makeup token can be re-added to your account. A paid open gym spot can be transferred for a $10 fee with 24 hours' notice prior to the event.

  * **Closures:** Tuition is not prorated for gym closures or holidays.
