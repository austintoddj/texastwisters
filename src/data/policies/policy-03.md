  ## Drop-off & Pick-up

  Please arrive on time so your child will not miss any warm-up. Children are not permitted to wait outside for their parents. Please pick your child up, on time, inside our facility. At drop-off, all students **MUST** have a parent remain with them until their class enters the gym.

  ## Emergency Closures & Inclement Weather

  We strive to be open for business as usual. However, unforeseen events like severe weather, natural disasters, or building emergencies may occasionally cause closures. During these times, we recommend calling the gym to confirm our status. Please check our Facebook & Instagram pages as well as your email for weather updates and closure information.

  ## Missed Classes & Makeups

  * **Makeup Classes:** We offer open gym sessions for makeup classes. Tokens for open gym sessions are added to your account when you are marked absent and expire after one year.

  * **Closures:** Tuition is not prorated for gym closures or holidays.
