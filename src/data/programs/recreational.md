    ## Our approach at Texas Twisters Gymnastics

    Our multi-level program fosters a safe, uplifting environment where kids progress at their own pace. With low student to coach ratios, we can ensure an optimal amount of hands-on coaching for each student and a wide variety of events and drills every week.

    ### Skill progression and development

    * Beginner Level
        * Learn the basics, including forward and backward rolls, cartwheels, and handstands. Develop strength and flexibility through exercises like straight-arm bridge holds. Get introduced to vaulting with squat-ons and dive rolls, and begin bar work with pike glide swings and pullovers. Build balance on the beam with relev√® walks and straight jumps.

    * Intermediate Level
        * Work on more complex skills like back hip circles on bars, tuck jumps on beam, and handstand flatbacks on vault. Introduce backbends, handstand forward rolls, and round-off rebounds to floor tumbling. Continue to build strength, flexibility, and confidence.

    * Advanced Level
        * Refine advanced techniques like front handsprings over the vault, round-off back handsprings on floor, and front hip circles on bars. Challenge balance and precision on the beam with split jumps, full turns, and cartwheels. Prepare for higher-level gymnastics with a focus on technique and performance.

    At the heart of our program lies a commitment to creating a space where children can explore the remarkable potential of their talent. Through highly-skilled coaching with an emphasis on safety, we aim to inspire a sense of accomplishment, intent on helping each child grow not only as an athlete but as a confident, disciplined individual.
