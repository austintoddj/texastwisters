testimonial: My 11-year-old daughter has been taking the Intermediate Tumbling Class at Texas Twisters, and we've been so impressed! After years at a different gym where she could only do a front flip with a coach's help or special equipment, here, she learned to land a front flip completely on her own in just a few months. She's now confidently working on her back handspring. She absolutely loves coming to class, and the progress she's made has been incredible. We're so glad we found Texas Twisters and highly recommend them.
