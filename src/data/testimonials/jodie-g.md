testimonial: We have really enjoyed our experience. Our son started in the pre-k class about a month ago and he was immediately welcomed into class and has really enjoyed it. We also had his birthday party here this past weekend and his teacher has said all the kids are talking about how much fun they had. Becky and the coaches were great with the kids we had who covered a wide range of ages. Thanks for the great experience and we look forward to watching our son continue to grow and learn.
