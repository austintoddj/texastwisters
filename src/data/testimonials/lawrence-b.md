testimonial: Love this place! I see why they have 4.9 stars. We have been coming here for a year now. My daughter has gotten so much better! She only attends once a week but has shown so much growth and improvement. I can only imagine how much faster her growth would be if we attended more days. Coach Bailey is an amazing teacher and coach! We have recently gotten a new coach and this one has been doing a great job so far with my daughter and the other girls! Coach Bo is another great coach who does a great job with the boys. Observing him while watching my daughter workout. I highly recommend this place! Great gem in Georgetown!
